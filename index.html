          <p>My name is Kayla Muraoka, a senior at Santa Clara University, set to graduate
            in August
            2020 with a dual
            degree
            consisting of a BSc in Management Information Systems and BA in Japanese Studies. As someone having
            experienced working
            full time and studying in Japan, I am passionate about working for a multinational retail corporation with
            close ties to
            Japan.</p>
          <p>
            My technical Management Information Systems coursework has equipped me with a broad understanding of
            business and the
            computer applications needed to support business activities. I've attained the skills necessary to leverage
            data,
            discover market opportunities, and deliver business solutions. On the other hand, my Japanese studies
            coursework,
            including a semester spent abroad at Nanzan University in 2019, while also serving as a photo & social media
            correspondent for IES has deepened my knowledge of Japanese culture and truly advanced my Japanese speaking,
            listening,
            reading, writing, and social skills.</p>

          <p>As a recruiting intern at Optia Partners, an executive recruiting firm in Tokyo, I was directly
            responsible
            for sourcing
            a candidate where the company was able to successfully introduce, resulting in a 27-thousand dollar sale. I
            was awarded
            the Optia Internship Award for the most sales pitch phone calls and appointments of all the interns, thus
            proving my
            ability to navigate linguistic barriers, and adapt to and overcome various cultural differences. I gained
            professional
            skills and industry exposure on a global level.</p>

          <p>I am actively involved on the SCU campus as a member of the women's club ultimate frisbee team, Kappa Kappa
            Gamma Eta Nu
            chapter, Intramural basketball team, while maintaining a full course load as well as working part-time as a
            sales
            associate at Quay Australia, an optical retailer. My academic and extra-curricular activity schedule
            confirms my work
            ethic, competitive drive, ability to juggle multiple responsibilities and priorities, and work as a part of
            a team. My
            leadership experience as a student ambassador, camp counselor, silent auction lead for Relay for Life, and
            group leader
            for the YMCA, provides the skills to make me an asset to and thrive in a fast-paced commercial environment.
          </p>

          <p>I believe that my work ethic, positive attitude, and eagerness to learn from every experience combined with
            my technical
            skill-set, international experience, leadership experience, and communication skills make me a versatile
            employee.
